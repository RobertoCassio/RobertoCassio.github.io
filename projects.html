        <h2> Beto Bot</h2>
        <div class="text">This is a discord bot made in Phyton, it was one of my first projects in this language. <br>
            When playing with my friends, we started to feel that the current discord bot's weren't supplying our necessities. <br>
            So i decided to made one myself, that could get songs from youtube and even show the lyrics when needed.
